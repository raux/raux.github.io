## About
The First International Workshop on Intertwining Research and Education on Software (WIREDS2024) is a pioneering initiative designed to bridge the gap between research and education within the Japanese software community. This workshop aims to foster an environment where expert researchers, students, educators, and practitioners can engage in meaningful dialogue about cutting-edge and disruptive innovations in software development and engineering.

WIREDS2024 seeks to establish a platform for the next generation of younger researchers by facilitating the exchange of ideas, experiences, and knowledge across all aspects of software. The workshop is committed to cultivating a collaborative atmosphere that encourages the sharing of diverse perspectives, ultimately contributing to the growth and evolution of software researchâ€”not only in Japan but in a way that is mutually beneficial for the global community.
