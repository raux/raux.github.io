My work now fits into these three buckets and depending on the collaboration, it can be more or less. 

# Theme I: Software as Ecosystems
Nowadays software is not built in isolation, we rely on many third-party library dependencies and frameworks to use functionality. Problems arise when developers struggle to manage these dependencies. 
My research interests span the themes of the holistic concept of that these dependencies form ecosystems that evolve and intetwine together over time. With the rise of library package ecosystems, I conduct empirical analysis of software ecosystems such as Maven for Java, NPM for JavaScript, and PyPI for Python. 

# Theme II: Developer Proficiency as Code
We take the concept of lingustic frameworks for assessing an individual natural language skill applied to how developers are writing this code. Defined as code proficiency, I am particularly interested in the role of developer proficiency through understanding how they code. We would like to measure developers skill based on the code, how the code can also be used as a signalling device for collaborators. We investigate how educators are teaching programming languages, and how developers try to move from basic coding concepts to more complex structures. Currently, we focus on the Python programming language and Pythonic code.

# Theme III: Bridging Developers Across Societies
Software development is now a global society. This research field aims to understand how developer from emerging nations like Papua New Guinea integrate software engineering into their society. I host international collaborators, workshops and internships with a global perspective.
