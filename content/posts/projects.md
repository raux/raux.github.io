### WIREDS
Software powers our everyday lives. The First International Workshop on Intertwining Research & Education on Software (WIREDS2024) is a pioneering initiative designed to bridge the gap between research and education within the Japanese software community to bring top class research to the global community. This workshop aims to foster an environment where expert researchers, students, educators, and practitioners can engage in meaningful dialogue about cutting-edge and disruptive innovations in software development and engineering.

WIREDS2024 seeks to establish a local platform for the next generation of younger researchers in Japan by brining in rising stars from the global. The workshop is committed to cultivating a collaborative atmosphere that encourages the sharing of diverse perspectives, ultimately contributing to the growth and evolution of software researchâ€”not only in Japan but in a way that is mutually beneficial for the global community.

- **PBL Programs (2020~)**
I have been involved in Program Based Learning for master students. We have entered a programming contest, written registered reports and created a curriculum for high school students.

- **High School Internship Program (2021~)**
We provided an opportunity for high school students to learn advanced research topics in research. The outcome was students learning basic programming in Python and the ability to build algorithms to play the Othello game.

- **Internships Programs with International Universities**
We have built collaborations with Mahidol University, Kasetsart University, Chiang Mai, which has results in students that have become members of the laboratory.
Recently have been working with Mahasiswa Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta Indonesia, and University of Technology in Papua New Guinea to start-up their internship programs.
