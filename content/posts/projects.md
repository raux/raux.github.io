# Theme 1: Software as an Ecosystem
My research interests span the themes of the holistic concept of software through Software Ecosystems and its broader impact on society. With the rise of library package ecosystems, I conduct empirical analysis of software ecosystems such as Maven for Java, NPM for JavaScript, and PyPI for Python. 

# Theme 2: Developer Proficiency as Code
I am particularly interested in the role of developer proficiency through understanding how they code. Concretely we would like to measure developers skill based on the code, how the code can also be used as a signalling device for collaborators and also how AI plays a role in this in the future. 

# Theme 3: Bridging Developers Across Societies
I originate from Papua New Guinea and reside in Japan. I believe that software development is a global activity and that developers from all parts of the world should be able to collaborate effectively. So I host international workshops and internships with a global perspective.

# Research Areas in Software Engineering 
As an empirical scientist, my team investigates hypotheses related to mining software repositories. 
We gather both project and meta-data to explore various facets of software ecosystems, aiming to uncover patterns that inform our understanding of their evolution and health. Below are the research areas that it overlaps. 

## Human and Society
A key theme across all my research areas is the exploration of human and social aspects within software ecosystems. 
This research looks into how communication and human interactions shape software development processes and ultimately affect the societal impact of software. Code proficiency impacts these interactions, as developers with higher skill levels may be more effective communicators and collaborators in a software development environment.
- Developer Skills and Education
- Software Ecosystem Sustainability and collaboration

## Ecosystem Evolution
We examine the evolution of software ecosystems and how these changes impact software maintenance activities. T
his includes research on code reviews, software documentation practices, and communication dynamics among developers as ecosystems evolve.
Code proficiency is a central factor in how software evolves, as highly proficient developers tend to drive improvements in code quality and maintainability.
- Software Ecosystem-level Maintenance
- Maintenance and Code Proficiency

## Ecosystem Security
In the realm of security, we analyze various aspects of software ecosystems to assess their vulnerability to both external and internal threats. 
This research is increasingly connected to ethical concerns and societal issues, as we explore the implications of security within software supply chains and the broader ecosystem. 
Code proficiency plays a critical role in identifying potential vulnerabilities, as more skilled developers are better equipped to implement secure coding practices.
- Software Ecosystem Security
- Code Proficiency and Security

## In the Era of AI
AI-assistance is already taking over, hence, my research covers this from an ecosystem perspective and also how code proficiency plays a role in this. 
I explore how artificial intelligence is becoming an integral part of developers' daily workflows, influencing the way software is developed, maintained, and documented. 
Additionally, I investigate how code proficiency influences the effective use of AI tools by developers in enhancing their workflows.
