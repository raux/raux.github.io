My research interests span the themes of Software Ecosystems and Code Proficiency and the broader impact of software on society. 
I collaborate with a wide range of experts across different topics within Software Engineering, contributing to the ongoing discourse on how software is evolving and shaping the world around us.

# AI for Software Engineering
My research focuses on understanding how developers communicate and create documentation within software ecosystems, particularly in the context of AI usage. 
I explore how artificial intelligence is becoming an integral part of developers' daily workflows, influencing the way software is developed, maintained, and documented. 
Additionally, I investigate how code proficiency influences the effective use of AI tools by developers in enhancing their workflows.

# Analytics
As an empirical scientist, my team investigates hypotheses related to mining software repositories. 
We gather both project and meta-data to explore various facets of software ecosystems, aiming to uncover patterns that inform our understanding of their evolution and health. 
We also explore how different levels of code proficiency among developers affect the quality of the mined data and the insights drawn from it.

# Dependability and Security
In the realm of security, we analyze various aspects of software ecosystems to assess their vulnerability to both external and internal threats. 
This research is increasingly connected to ethical concerns and societal issues, as we explore the implications of security within software supply chains and the broader ecosystem. 
Code proficiency plays a critical role in identifying potential vulnerabilities, as more skilled developers are better equipped to implement secure coding practices.

# Evolution
We examine the evolution of software ecosystems and how these changes impact software maintenance activities. T
his includes research on code reviews, software documentation practices, and communication dynamics among developers as ecosystems evolve.
Code proficiency is a central factor in how software evolves, as highly proficient developers tend to drive improvements in code quality and maintainability.

# Human and Social Aspects
A key theme across all my research areas is the exploration of human and social aspects within software ecosystems. 
This research delves into how communication and human interactions shape software development processes and ultimately affect the societal impact of software. 
Code proficiency impacts these interactions, as developers with higher skill levels may be more effective communicators and collaborators in a software development environment.
